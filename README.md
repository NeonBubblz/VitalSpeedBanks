# Workflow
1) Select bank components (presets, tables, lfos, samples) from a file browser to add to each list individually, or use "Auto Add" to select a folder of components to add automatically--components from subfolders are also included.
2) Name your bank and press "EXPORT", choosing the directory to export it to

# "Advanced"
- Using the labled checkboxes underneath the action buttons allows you to specify which components to affect (e.g. pressing "Auto Add" with only "Wavetables" checked will add only the wavetables from the folder you selected; pressing "Remove All" with all checkboxes enabled will remove all items from each list)
- You can use Ctrl+A to select all items in a list
- You can dynamically resize the GUI
